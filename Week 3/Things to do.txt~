separate out the vocab list as before..

write a method "count" which accepts the key and checks both the vocab and freq list for it.

in test.cpp - implement part 1 by going through the test file given by martin, replacing the first word with all possible words in the vocab and summing over the frequencies.

figure out count counts of uni/bigrams..
